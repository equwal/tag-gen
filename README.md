Generate tags for a list of files and extensions.

![EXUBERANT ctags](https://therealtruex.com/static/ctags.webp)

# PURPOSE:
Specify which directories to generate tags for, and what kinds of files
to generate them for in each. Good for tag jumping in an editor.

# Requirements
- An ANSI Common Lisp
- A ctags-like program.
- Desire

# Non-features/Non-Requirements
- Not multithreaded!
- Works with any tag program (doesn't do any tagging itself)!
- No special configuration language, just two sexps!
- Does not use Roswell!
- Works on my machine!

# Install

1. put this folder somewhere
2. put the config folder somewhere
3. put the tag-gen.sh and tag-gen-root.sh somewhere
4. put the cron job in
5. put your configuration in

Edit the config/ files with the paths you want tagged.

Add a command to cron like:
```
*/29 * * * * su username -c 'tag-gen.sh      /path/to/tag-gen/local.conf /usr/bin/etags'
*/29 * * * * su root     -c 'tag-gen-root.sh /path/to/tag-gen/root.conf  /usr/bin/etags'
```
for routine tagging.

tags.conf needs to contain this kind of format:
```
"/path/to/ctags/program"

(("<directory>" ("<ext>"...))
  ...)
```
The tags program reads the file extensions to infer what language to do tags for. Specify the directories you want to
use tag browsing programs on.


See examples in config-examples. Configuration is **mandatory** for the
program to work. The format is just read with the lisp reader and is
very simple.
