Generate etags for a list of files and extensions.

===
Requirements
===
- A cron program like cronie or scron
- The Roswell Common Lisp script bootstrapper
- a tagging program like etags

===
Install
===

Add a command to cron like:
*/29 * * * * su username -c 'tag-gen.ros /home/username/.config/tag-gen/local.conf /usr/bin/etags 1'

Signature:

tag-gen.ros <conf> <tag program> [verbosity]

tags.conf needs to contain this kind of format:
(("<directory>" ("<ext>"...))
  ...)
See examples in config-examples. Configuration is **mandatory** for the program to work.

For example:
(("/home/jose/.emacs.d" ("el"))
 ("/home/jose/src/sf/sbcl/sbcl" ("lisp" "c")))

Keep in mind that the home shorthand ~ might not git expanded
properly! Always use absolute paths like in the examples.

For output control, call with a debug argument 0, 1, 2 where:
- 0 is silent
- 1 is for serious errors
- 2 is for everything

Edit tgen and put it in the path.

===
TODO
===
Use GNU Make to put things in the PATH and to form absolute paths.
