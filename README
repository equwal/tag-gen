Generate tags for a list of files and extensions.

===
Requirements
===
- A Common Lisp. ECL, SBCL, and CLISP are fine.
- a tagging program like etags or ctags

===
Install
===

Run make in this folder.

Edit the config/ files with the paths you want tagged. Read the docs
for your tag program to know how to tell it what languages to use.

Add a command to cron like:
*/29 * * * * su username -c 'tag-gen.sh      /path/to/tag-gen/local.conf /usr/bin/etags 1'
*/29 * * * * su root     -c 'tag-gen-root.sh /path/to/tag-gen/root.conf  /usr/bin/etags 1'
for routine tagging.

Signature:


tags.conf needs to contain this kind of format:
(("<directory>" ("<ext>"...))
  ...)
See examples in config-examples. Configuration is **mandatory** for the program to work.

For example:
(("/home/jose/.emacs.d" ("el"))
 ("/home/jose/src/sf/sbcl/sbcl" ("lisp" "c")))

Keep in mind that the home shorthand ~ might not git expanded
properly! Always use absolute paths like in the examples.

For output control, call with a debug argument 0, 1, 2 where:
- 0 is silent
- 1 is for serious errors
- 2 is for everything
